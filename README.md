IconForFileType
===============
I needed a way to extract an icon for an app I was writing.  More details in my blog post: <http://www.socketwiz.com/post/893951576/mac-how-to-extract-an-icon>

At any rate, I couldn't find the one I was looking for, so I wrote this little utility to extract it for me.  It will extract an icon from a file type that you type in such as pdf, doc or zip for example, or from a file path that you give it.
